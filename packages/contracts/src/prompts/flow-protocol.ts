/**
 * Staged-flow prompt segment (specs/current/staged-flow-north-star.zh-CN.md §5.2).
 *
 * Single source of truth for the `<od-flow …/>` marker contract the agent is
 * asked to follow. Both prompt composers (daemon local runs and the BYOK/API
 * mirror) splice this block in verbatim for flow-shaped runs, so the wording
 * cannot drift between surfaces. Stage duties are rendered from the
 * `FLOW_SHAPES` registry — the same registry the web progress card and the
 * CLI read — keeping prompt and UI in lockstep per shape.
