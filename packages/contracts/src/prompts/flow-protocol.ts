/**
 * Staged-flow prompt segment (specs/current/staged-flow-north-star.zh-CN.md §5.2).

 * Single source of truth for the `<od-flow …/>` marker contract the agent is

 * mirror) splice this block in verbatim for flow-shaped runs, so the wording
 * cannot drift between surfaces. Stage duties are rendered from the
 * `FLOW_SHAPES` registry — the same registry the web progress card and the
 * CLI read — keeping prompt and UI in lockstep per shape.

    'This protocol overrides active skill, plugin, pipeline, Todo, and verification instructions whenever they would continue past the current user-visible checkpoint. Completing the whole artifact in one turn is a correctness failure, not helpful autonomy.',

    '- While generating, refresh progress with done/total counts: <od-flow stage="generate" state="active" done="3" total="12"/>.',
    '- Markers are machine protocol, not prose: never mention them to the user, never wrap them in code fences, and never leave a started stage without a terminal marker.',
    `- Task shape: ${shape}. In the plan stage, write ${artifacts} before any renderable artifact. Run the research stage only when the task needs external facts (or the user enabled deep research); otherwise emit state="skipped" for it.`,
    `- Clarify only missing essentials for this shape: ${spec.clarifyDefaults.join(', ')}. Pre-fill safe defaults so the user can continue without typing.`,
    `- Plan grammar: start with \`# ${plan.title}\`, then one \`## N. ${plan.itemLabel} title\` heading per item with ${plan.pointsLabel.toLowerCase()} as \`-\` bullets. ${plan.instructions} Keep this structure stable so the user can edit, add, remove, and reorder items in the plan panel.`,

Its defaultValue must be "confirm"; options must be "confirm" (labelled with the exact unit count, such as "✓ Confirm, generate 12 slides") and "modify" ("I want to make changes"), with allowCustom enabled. Then END THE TURN IMMEDIATELY.',
    '- At that boundary, do not continue remaining Todos, copy a seed, run final-artifact checks, invoke generation tools, or write any renderable/final artifact. Reading framework references is allowed; applying them is not.',
    '- Never create or edit HTML, images, video, audio, or another final artifact before the user submits the plan-confirm form with the confirm option. If they request changes, update the plan artifact and ask for confirmation again.',
    '- In the inspire stage, wait for the explicit [inspiration — template-id] or skip message. Apply the selected design-template as the visual source of truth.',
    `- Generate a usable framework or document skeleton first, then fill it ${plan.itemLabel.toLowerCase()}-by-${plan.itemLabel.toLowerCase()} or in small batches. Persist each batch and emit generate progress after every batch so the preview remains continuously useful and does not flicker.`,
